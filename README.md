# college-facility-booking-system

### **Project Description:**

SmartCampus Booker is a web-based application developed to simplify and digitize the process of booking institutional facilities within a college campus. It allows registered users (students and faculty) to request bookings for spaces such as auditoriums, labs, seminar halls, and sports areas.

The system centralizes the booking process and provides an admin interface to manage requests, approve or reject bookings, and maintain a record of all usage, improving operational efficiency and minimizing scheduling conflicts.
